Evolutionary history of the satellite dark halos during a merger

Abstract

Understanding the dynamical properties of dark matter halos during mergers is an important ingredient for models of galaxy formation. In this thesis, we study evolutionary histories of satellite dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We show that halo mergers in the present-day universe have more circular orbits than those in earlier universe. We also find evidence for correlations between the orbits and environment effects based of Press-Schechter mass function.
Our merging simulations cover a wide parameter space in terms of mass ratio, energy and eccentricity. We find that the mass loss of the satellites is primarily affected by the orbital parameters and the shape of the host halo potential. We compare N-body simulation results with an analytic Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. Based on average rate of mass loss of the satellite haloes with randomly selected eccentricities, we find that the analytic approach with a free parameter Î±=0.4 for mass loss can reproduce the N-body simulation results.

Preface
In now days, the most preferred cosmological model is Hierarchical Cosmology, which is a small scale to large scale through merging. The mechanics interpretation of the merging halo is essential to understand the process of galaxy formation and evolution. Despite having a detailed understanding of the merging process between the Halos, the previous studies have overlooked the merging process or described the merging process using a very simple approximation (Chandrasekhar 1943). In addition, the orbital information distribution of the merging satellite halo used in most semi-analytic model (SAM) not only uses the orbit information calculated in the present universe (z=0), but also does not use sufficient samples.
In the Chandrasekhar approximation, the satellite Halo loses all of its mass as it enters the virial radius of the central halo. The merging time is so short that the role of the merging satellite halo is not much in this case. Figure 1.1 is an X-ray image of the Fornax cluster. Unlike the merge process described in the Chandrasekhar approximation, the X-ray observations result in a satellite halo that is not merged inside the virial radius of the central halo. Recent numerical simulations have shown that merging satellite halo in a large scale halo group survives for a considerable time (Klypin etal. 1998; Moore et al. 1999a). As the merging time of the satellite halo increases, it interacts with the central halo, so the role of the merging satellite halo is not only negligible but also a very important physical phenomenon for understanding galaxy formation and evolution.
